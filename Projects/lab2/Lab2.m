%The striking mechanism of a weaving machine consists of a four bar linkage. 
%In a particular case, such a linkage is required to coordinate five positions of the rocker follower
%with five positions of the input crank as shown in the Table 1. The length of the fixed
%link is required to be 180mm.
%%
%Values of input and output angles are given below
input_angle = [40; 45; 50; 55; 60]
output_angle = [70; 76; 83; 91; 100]

%Evaluate K1, K2 and K3 using the least square method, and hence determine the
%length of the other links
